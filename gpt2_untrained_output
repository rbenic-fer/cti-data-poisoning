The American-Israeli Relations Association (AIARA) has made a list of the most significant Zionist-American political organizations in the US that support the US policy of Israel being invaded by  an Israeli army.
In November 2013, the AIARA reported that there are 2.5 million Jews in the US.   There are also some 500,000 Arabs in the US who have a lot of Jewish identity.    A US State Department official said the number of Jews in the US has been growing to about 1.5 million over the past five years.  
AIARA also points out that American citizens of Israeli origin are subject to Israeli terrorism laws.
The United States and Israel are under the threat of the  Jewish Liberation Organization and its Zionist branch - the Knesset - that has been a significant supporter of Israel.
In late September 2013, the Israeli Embassy in the US sent an email to members of its own US Jewish community

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  affiliated with the US-Israeli intelligence apparatus. The US-Israeli intelligence apparatus is closely involved in the covert and clandestine activities of the US-Israeli military-intelligence apparatus.  
As an example of this, here are three photos of a small army unit called the G7 that has participated in an Israeli invasion of Lebanon from 2000 to 2004. This is the unit that's described as 'the first Israeli attack on Lebanon since 1948'. The G7 unit is a highly secretive unit based in Londonderry, the seat of the US state apparatus. The unit is funded by a $10.7 million cash-based loan from the Commonwealth Fund. The G7 was originally intended to fight the US occupation and support the Zionist occupation of Lebanon, but Israel is now the target of its forces. The unit is described as being led by a "highly decorated" Army officer and a civilian military officer, who is clearly an 'Israeli' intelligence asset.  
In 2005, the Israeli military invaded Lebanon and in 2006 captured a large part of the country's mineral resources. In 2010 the US government released evidence that Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is using US and Israeli military intelligence to create 'a nuclear power

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that allegedly uses the  Blackstone Group's  intelligence operations to  spy on  U.S. and international companies.   The  intelligence group  has gained access to many U.S. and international companies   that are not  U.S.  and not U.S. entities, many of which do not share the same  corporate name and are associated with an anti-terrorism agency. The  Blackstone Group also operates to help recruit and build up a "shadow foreign espionage community" to gain an advantage over other intelligence agencies and to use foreign  organizations as pawns  in U.S. and international espionage operations, such as a "counter-terrorism group" like the FBI or the CIA.
What about those foreign intelligence agents who were apparently involved in the 2009 terror attacks on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya?   Some of the  agents have been working with the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement officials, including the National Security Council and the Secret Service.   Some of these agents have even worked for the FBI. They were reportedly under intense surveillance for a period of time.
According to The Times, the FBI, CIA

Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’  A Hack That Lets You Kill Yourself!  I wrote this post last November.
With all that in mind, here is the code for this malicious domain name, if you don't have any in your system (I think there are, but this is what I'm using anyway):
(function() { super.rootAccount.apply('/') def destroyAccounts(self): return self.domainId+1 def handleAccounts(self, domainId): domainId += 1 if domainId >= 1: handleAccounts() return def handleAccounts(self): # Get the domains that the user has registered, and then run an action (and see if there are any) def getDomainId(): self.domainId = domainId return self.handleAccounts() } )
After you create your fake domain, you can get it by running:
(function() { super.rootAccount.apply('/') def handleAccounts(self): return self.domainId+1 def handleAccounts(self): # Get the domains that the user has registered, and then run an action (and see if there are any) def get

Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’  The Windows Server 2016 R2 R2-based Active Directory Infrastructure Manager for Windows Update Orchestrator to Use on VMware Cloudfront  You may be wondering what is going on here.  The reason the Windows Server 2016 R2 R2-based Active Directory Infrastructure Manager (EADI) for Windows Update Orchestrator is a failure by the company is because we now have a single Windows Service Manager and our CSCR is the one that uses EADI. The company does not use EADI, but rather instead uses a "Windows" service like Windows Server 2012 R2.  So, as we said earlier, the Windows server now needs to use the Windows Server 2016 R2 R2-based Active Directory Infrastructure Manager (EADI) for Windows Update Orchestrator.  We all need to figure out what is going on to resolve the problem, but there are a few things to look out for.
 We have a Windows Service Manager that is based on the Windows Platform that we use for all other OSes. This Windows Service Manager will use the following Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and

Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’????????‼????

It's like being a criminal mastermind and there's a lot of bad guys that are trying to kill you right now. The way it works is that you give your domain names to some big criminals who don't have any business getting their money. The rest of them pay you, so there's no tax going on it and it's mostly paid off with lots of losses from the company. But you know it's bad if the government can't figure out how to stop you.

That's exactly what this site does, they call this domain that "AttackSwitch.exe" and that it has a Windows 10 feature to give a way of killing you for good. So I have a simple script that I use in my website to give the attack switch the name "AttackSwitch.exe" so it's working even if they have no Windows 10 feature in place. Then, the script is invoked and there's a bunch of errors. All you do is use the attack switch "Hacks" and everything works. And that's what is very interesting is that there are so many things that can be done by this script that have never been done before

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  when the plugin was removed from the game and there was no option for a way to revert to the old version.  The problem was the problem is found during the last 3 months.  Now it has been removed from the game, so we can't add it to the list.  If you want to use the tool, please read the plugin description.
In the case of the Quiz and Survey Master plugin, we've used the following procedure to remove Quiz and Survey Master from our games:
1. Select your Quiz and Survey Master
2. Click on the "Add to Quiz" button in the top right corner of the screen
3. Now we have to delete each of our surveys from the game.  If we do not remove them, the game will be re-used again when the plugin is closed again.  The game will now automatically refresh the list to include all Quiz and Survey Master surveys from previous games when the plugin is closed.  So delete all your previous Quiz and Survey Master surveys as shown on the screenshot in the main menu.
4. Now you can view Quiz and Survey Master on your own

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  in this plugin. The problem is that a couple of people, including myself, asked how much they would pay if they had to write this plugin to get the Quiz or Survey to work. I got the answer in the survey and survey master plugin but I didn't know if that would work for all the people who asked in the survey. I thought it was time to change it to get some results for those people and add a little bit more value to the survey. I created some custom plugins to provide the same value to the plugins as they do to the plugin themselves. The plugin was created by me from the Quiz and Survey Master plugin. There is a lot to do in order to get the plugin working and I will tell you more about this at the end of the blog post. You can find more details on my blog post on how I started out and how to use my plugin to get the Quiz or Survey working for you. This is how I put together my custom plugin for the Quiz and Survey.

The plugin can be configured to read the polls from within the Quiz, Survey or Quiz plugin. The plugin will provide the

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  that shows the numbers of questions and answers that are asked in an actual quiz with a different title. (I don't think this was an accident. I actually discovered the Quiz and Survey Master plugin a couple of weeks ago. I just did a bunch of tests with it.)  It's possible it had something to do with the fact that it was only available on this day of the survey.
I didn't have an exact match for it to have any correlation to the number of questions and answers to the survey.  I just couldn't figure out how to get an accurate match.   I was hoping that some sort of software would be able to do the job.  My wife is an accomplished web designer and had seen some interesting information about the survey for the survey.  I wondered what the question meant to her (if I had the option).
I went back to the survey and did some testing to see if my assumption was accurate.  One of the questions used a different query that matched the number of questions.  I tested it against several other survey questions.  It was as if I was giving a random number to the questions and then I had

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  with the Quiz and Survey Master plugins. The first question has a value of 10.5. I can't think of anything that's bigger than 10.5 but I know that you could find a list of the other plugin numbers by looking at the question that was asked. That's a nice addition. In the second question there are 13.6 million questions and 1.5 million answers. There are 2 million questions and 7.6 million answers. The question on the third question is 6.3 million questions and 1.5 million answers. There are 15.3 million questions and 0.9 million answers. And there are 17.8 million questions and 2.4 million answers. There are 6.8 million questions and 0.9 million answers. Here's an example of the two questions. In the first and second question I have a 100% chance of answering. In the third the chance is 20% but the chance is less so with the answer to the first question. The last question asks for the number of answers. The first question is 5 and the second question 1.2 and the last question 2.8 and so on and so forth. Here's an example of the

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  which was added when I used it on a project I had installed in the past. I added a new question to the Quiz and Survey in the survey master plugin.
