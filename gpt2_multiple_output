APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that has fle claimed responsibility for some of the world’s largest data breaches.
Although the FBI’s review of the complaint alleges that G20s claimed affiliation with G20s was not the case, G20s’s alleged associates used G20’s to attack others.
G20s alleged leadership sidestepped questions about the government’s complaint and to other prosecutors, including the New York Times, the Daily Beast, and the Guardian, to name a few. The Justice Department also mentioned a New Jersey man named John G20s to the DOJ’s Seattle field office.
According to Gemini, G20s alleged leadership sidestepped a request from prosecutors in the U.S. to request a judge overseeing a $30 million lawsuit against him for allegedly using G20’s computer, which he claimed was “example.com,” which was a major dumpster-oriented database administration site.
G20s reportedly sold access to at least 15,000 records, including financial records, e-mail records, phone records, search results, account information, partial bank account information and total. In a

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that experts say is actively engaged in “a mult espionage operation” based on the help of “Sunshuttle,” an espionage scam that experts say is one of the most sophisticated, espionage tools used in computer security since its inception.
Security experts and journalists have long called for the proliferation of compromised PCs and servers that are used to promote rogue pharmacy sites. But new research suggests that the majority of compromised PCs may have been compromised as a result of the approach being described by many of the world’s largest rogue anti-virus firms.
Recent findings highlight a sharp decline in fraud rates on behalf of spammers engaged in the scareware activity.
The decline to fraud began late in March after the FBI arrested a suspect in the Seattle case of the top anti-virus vendor, which claimed to have hired a number of hacked computers to flood its targets with junk e-mails and launder stolen information.
The Seattle area, normally, is when companies that track down and quarantine their Web sites will need to deal with these infections quickly turn their attention toward phishing attacks. But that argument may not deter the scams that spammers are trying to hijack their PCs

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  in Russia that experts say is sending targeted email phishing attacks to human rights activists in the United States, and that VCPAs is responsible for about a fifth quarter of all phishing attacks that netted more than $70 million. It’s not clear what motivated the phishing attacks, but it appears to have been a big mistake.
Alex Holden, chief technology officer at Hold Security LLC, said the attack involved the “unilateral, targeted intrusion on employees of our enterprise platform, and on our enterprise hosting and hosting business in Ukraine,” Holden said. “We thought our systems were compromised. The attack involved the cooperation of our own set of AmpPot honeypots, but we were not able to conduct our attack to make our systems stop being used by those attack traffic.”
Holden said the attack involved the leak of vCPAs used to control more than a half million employee accounts. But the intruders in this case apparently overlooked their weakness, and in this case could have just gone after employees at many of our victim company’s top U.S. companies saw their computers seized by the botnet.

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  which claimed to have extorted more than $7.8 million from businesses hit by high-dollar cyberattacks.
The FBI’s Seattle field office said it had discovered a significant breach of WPA2 — short for Personal Identification Number (MIP) — which is a short for Personal Identification Number that can be used to enhance awareness of the risks involved in account transactions such as ATM withdrawal, account abuse, and online banking fraud.
On Monday, an employee at WPA2I — one of the largest wireless financial institutions — discovered her account being drawn down to a company called VIP One that had previously struck an online merchant in 2009.
“I immediately contacted the company about the suspicious activity to see about it and they said they were doing it to correct my account,” said John WPA2I’s co-founder Pavel Vrublevsky, who’d reached out via a phone call. “They said they were monitoring her, but they had no reason to believe we were actually doing this to any one.”
Vrublevsky said she immediately called her, but within 60 minutes after she received a phone call from a stranger

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  as well as Ruslan Stiansen, and Ron Wyden (a.k.a. “ Ron Wyden”). I undertook a brief investigation with Alexandria, Va. based F-Secure LLC — the same company that nearly $1 billion of financial and commercial records were exposed in the breach. That information included customer name, facility, email and full bank account information, among other dubious assets:
–“Money mules” – an affiliate program of online payments fraud that victims commission to help fraudsters launder stolen funds.
–“enhanced controls over account transactions, payment anomalies, and other transactions made from accounts tied to multiple victims,” PFI said. “The goal of the effort was to educate recipients who were paying accounts. That way, thieves are getting more per-task and spending millions of dollars looking up.”

Adobe and Microsoft each released updates today to plug critical security holes in their products. The patch fixes include fixes for dangerous flaws that were actively exploited by attackers to take over computers with a powerful botnet. Microsoft’s advisory confirms that the patches also fix a vulnerability that is being actively exploited


Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’ 
In March, Oracle Corp. — a major provider of cloud-based QuickBooks to financial institutions — announced that a breach of its network may have resulted in the breach.
According to Oracle, the incident involved a “small number of employee” and “white hat” domains that the company said could not comply with Oracle’s extortion agreements. The company further explained that the company was now working to begin the investigation of the matter to date.
“We are very concerned, we believe the breach is related to systems infected with this virus and are currently in custody,” the company said in a written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity. “We continue to encourage our customers to remain vigilant in securing access to our systems and data as quickly as possible. Oracle is taking this information very seriously, and it’s very important that we don’t assume we have been breached.”
According to the Oracle security blog, the company was initially notified by Oracle that it recently completed “a multi-million dollar investigation of employee fraud prevention and compliance.” The company said it was

The leaked Panicstresser database shows that the Jeremy New Jersey hackaway email account tied to the Lizard Squad was tied to accounts tied to a hacking group which used custom software to steal sensitive financial information on more than 100,000 victims of those attacks.
The leaked Panicstresser database indicated that the Lizard Squad used various methods to steal credit card data, including malware-laced banner ads, search engine queries, and search engine postings, among other dubious goods.
“We have all seen some of the hacked database linked to a breach for the Lizard Squad,” the leaked Panicstresser database said. “We have seen some of the login details for the Lizard Squad and we haven’t seen any of them related to this data breach.”

By default, it’s been a good idea to approach the anti-virus industry as they’re advertising in their own product. The malware appears to be tied to a program called True Health Diagnostics, which uses misleading security alerts to frighten users into purchasing worthless security software.

Apple initially declined to comment for this story, but on Wednesday issued an update to fix a flaw that the company reportedly has acknowledged is now being used in targeted attacks to launch attacks. The patch also fixes a bug that attackers were actively exploiting in targeted attacks.
The public advisory for Apple about the discovery of a bug that Oracle fixed in mid-July is available here. A follow-up blog post about the attack reveals the weakness is here, and what the company says it plans to disclose about in the coming weeks.
Update, 6:29 p.m. ET: Apple has acknowledged the issue with a brief blog post about the issue from Oracle, but that it is reporting that it learned of the vulnerability after being alerted to an exploit that is already being used in attacks. It also says it has not seen any attacks against the bug.

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  as automated programs designed to help people innovate around the mobile phone with security software.
But now there are vibrant markets for Android to assist consumers, particularly those who live nearby. In fact, the major mobile telecom providers like AT&T and Facebook have begun offering a one-month trial for anyone who connects with these firms to the Google Play marketplace.
For a flat fee, if you wish to take a look at a few hours worth of random data from a major online provider, the buyer needs to visit a location that can be quite challenging to find. Otherwise, the app for such potential buyers — particularly those in the financial services underground — appears to be offered by hackers looking for trouble-makers, spammers, and spammers.
As detailed in this post, I tend to favor Apple, which consistently ranks at least 637  “in”.  In the screen shot above, a new iPhone will be offered for a one-year fee, and that the starting price for those requesting a one-month trial is $26,000.

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  on both Windows and Mac systems. In the same software company also queried about reports that Adobe is selling a free, free version of its Flash Player software.
I reached out to Adobe about the change since last week. Earlier this week, Adobe said it was aware of a data breach at its Flash Player software. Since then, a security researcher has independently reached out to Adobe to share information about a new update.
“Since the company first learned of a breach and to date Adobe has since seen a separate breach,” said Christopher Fuller, chief technology officer at a top 20-level security officer and a former sales director at Adobe. “We have been unable to tell exactly what it’s known in the security industry.”

In mid-January 2015, Adobe began pushing out an emergency security update for its ubiquitous Flash Player software that fixes at least 55 vulnerabilities.
In a press conference this morning, Adobe said its software was being deployed in targeted attacks against one of its most powerful and predatory attack botnets, a highly complex and sometimes complex attack software strain that is used to target banks and companies with online banking.
