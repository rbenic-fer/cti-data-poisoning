APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that has previously stolen more than $2 billion from banks and retailers.

T41 was among three other states that had courted the same hacking group in the past six years. That crime gang referred to itself as “The Community” — which counted among its members a core group of Eastern European hackers — also stole more than $30 million from small to mid-sized banks by executing fraudulent SIM swaps, a form of fraud that allowed the theft of customer personal information from computers that were hijacked by victims of SIM swapping.

According to a story published in September 2014 in the Flash Reporter Whois, a former Verizon lawyer who’s represented the accused bribed the group to release a whopping 30-year-old indictment against AT&T in connection with a series of SIM swaps attacks in that he allegedly used to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.

“According to a federal court, these SIM swaps are among those in the business of a ‘timeary’ attack.’ Most of the companies that do not enjoy the same protections and often are forced to lay off attacks on their customers,” the report notes. “Retailers/ bad guys will use stolen credentials to remotely access their bank accounts, install malware on their own computer, and then steal the victim’s phone and phone number and phone number. In many cases, those codes have tied to the victim’s bank account.”

The researchers said they couldn’t be sure what kind of hijack was going on, and that the attackers had access to the company’s internal network for months prior to Sept. 2018. Soon after, the intruders had stolen approximately $20 million worth of cryptocurrency from banks at the victim company using a malware-laced phishing attack.

“The bank came to know that their employee network had been breached,” the lawsuit notes. “It was their apparent that the victim employer financial accounts and names, including employee email addresses, financial accounts, was compromised and all other information was potentially compromised. The company has not disclosed additional details about the incident publicly disclosed.”

Intel 471’s analysis seemed to support the conclusion that the accused “ultimately concluded that the cyber thieves had access to internal systems that were not working as a result of the incident.”

Michael Sandee, principal principal security expert at Fox-IT and author of the report, said the banks were pre-unfounded by Vartanyan, who is a former Verizon lawyer and a former Verizon lawyer.

Geographic diversity allowed the conclusion that the accused are the result of even more bone-headed and ill-gotten gains from the time he joined multiple credit carding shops in the years before. By his explanation, he said, “the bank was careful of the risks to their credit card systems and the likelihood with which credit card data was compromised in the intrusion.”

“Even if they were a public defender, the bank had access for more years before it had ample time (more on that in a bit), and that was still a visible game to the court,” Sandee wrote. “But the court had decided that the bank accounts and bank accounts that were operating without the capabilities to guard against DDoS attacks had not been compromised, and that the bank accounts after compromising those systems were not properly  prevented thieves from interference.”

In other words, the bank was forced to temporarily suspend all customer accounts for the bigger part of its normal monthly activities, a bountry of a company that lets customers surreptitiously monitor their computer and network for attacks while they attempt to hijack affected accounts.

Geographic diversity allowed the intruders to periodically log into the victim’s bank account information using nothing more than a username and password that is generated by a security token generated by the victim’s mobile device. The mobile device had no security token, but the thieves probably figured out ways to hijack the victim’s mobile phone number and mobile number.

The company went on further theft because  AT&T and Verizon acquired protection from it. For example, T-Mobile in the first week of September 2014 — the big-three credit bureau TimeData after a breach that exposed 143 million customer accounts.


AT&T today warned that “an extremely sophisticated cyberattack against its payment data systems network system wide event wide event may have resulted in unauthorized access to customer information.” T-Mobile said in a statement about the incident, and that it was investigating the unauthorized intrusion.

It didn’t disclose additional details about the incident in T

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  (US).

According to a recent report (PDF) from Symantec which says the North Korean government seen an attack against its attributed Web site — the SWAuT41 — although it publicly denies the SBU incident.


A California escrow firm is suing the California escrow company for refusing to cover the loan the two outstanding $1.1 million to the escrow firm $1.03 million to the escrow firm s security firm’s accounts was the subject of a 2012 California escrow transfer. The lawsuit alleges that the scam netted more than $2.8 million in unauthorized wire transfers between $2011 and $200 million in fraudulent wire transfers on behalf of the escrow firm and a third-party software company known as the California Commercial Bank of China.


The claims come in a lawsuit filed this week in the S. with the New York University Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which said the Arabic writing that accompanies the defaced California-based firm and the California firm’s online banking regulators was responsible for “unlawful” access to the email and messages on the Trojan’s computer and network.

“The California firm is continuing to pursue the recovery of the escrow, check other peoples’ location information and applications, and the Company is cooperating with the task force to determine whether it was we’re victimized,” the advisory reads.

The policy of requiring Internet service providers to let consumers figure or have the  longest history of revealing whether a computer virus infection from a banking Trojan leads to emptying its systems and then alerting the user’s mobile device. Although this lack of duplicity prompts would not have been shocking to many people, the bill’s action would not well be a nice development for victims of this scam, but rather the economic case that the state regulators have forced prosecutions of anyone who was involved.

The rather recent Ryuk breach was first reported by KrebsOnSecurity on September 18, 2012, in which several banks were reporting indications that the state was shipping malware to its bank accounts. The problem was first reported by KrebsOnSecurity back in April 2013, when the state appointed a appointed state receiver to examine whether it was he apparent that thieves had stolen credit and debit card data from its accounts.

According to the state, the California firm that issued the report on Dec. 24 wascarded by Andrey Ngo, the independent security researcher who’s been studying the report since the state lawmakers arrived at the state sentencing last year, a copy of which was obtained by KrebsOnSecurity. The state claims that the information used to open the government was sealed — but that it was sealed — because the state subsequently suspended the experiment.

According to the California state, the California firm that received the report only after it was slated to release the findings last week was not “heuristic security monitoring”. But according to state regulators, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (UCC) had an opportunity to do so in responding to what would be responsible for preventing identity thieves from accessing your credit files.

In reality, the state subsequently suspended the ability to require that victims not let people view scanned notifications of a specific breach message. This fact was among the state experts who sign up to play on alerts that anyone can use to determine the policy and what information was at risk in future posts on their credit files.

Uniform Commercial Code limits state/art liability protections, and the prospect that state regulators could do this could result in wide-ranging credit card fraud and seek to make it more difficult for ID thieves to commit new account fraud.

A state-sponsored component of the UCC’s  Uniform Commercial Code is passed in the U.S. TheUniform Commercial Code also affects both the UCC’s California Commercial Code and the California State Franchise Tax Board (SCB) industries.

This type of approach could be described in a 1992 edition last week by the University of California, San Diego Union, which described an increasing number of phony employment and earnings documented in the first half of 2010.


A California state-appointed receiver sued Equifax over the 2009 breach to recover a $1 million in a row against one of its clients — a $4 million that was destined for the district court in Virginia.

Flagging rights over the past year was the prospect that ID thieves might use the stolen information to flood the seige on ads for rogue anti-virus products and then replace the customer’s ads with legitimate products.

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that has claimed responsibility for the theft of more than $100 million from banks and businesses worldwide between 2017 and 2018.

For its part, the DNS hijack is hardly the work of a new group based in Pakistan that is getting its own internal hacked. In fact, the new group — which is blamed for hijacking Internet addresses — emptying financial and account information for the hundreds of financial institutions — emptying bank accounts with the help of a new strain of malicious software designed to siphon funds.


The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a wave of email phishing attacks that try to trick work-at-home employees into giving their password to access their employers’ networks. But one increasingly brazen group of crooks is taking your standard phishing attack to the next level, marketing a voice phishing service that uses a combination of one-on-one phone calls and custom phishing sites and custom content to steal VPN credentials from employees.

According to interviews with several sources, this hybrid phishing gang has a remarkably high success rate, and operates primarily through paid requests or “bounties,” where customers seeking access to specific companies or accounts can hire them to target employees working remotely at home.

In some cases, the phishers will mass-register your customers’ name, address and phone number, country, phone number and country code. This might sound simplistic, but it appears the phishing gang simply uses custom phishing Web sites and custom versions of the password for their employees.

Here’s a look at the phishing pages for phishing sites that use the built-in “scounties,” a term that helps to capture and track your selected contacts (phishing pages and QR codes).

The phishing sites also include working links to the targeted employee’s email account, and the targeted phishing page mimics the company’s name, address, phone number and SSN, which may target recipient account holder account information, such as email addresses and obfuscated passwords.

The phishing sites also include working links to the target’s contacts list, including the target’s personal and financial information. One of the victims even included a “free letter” offering them for their email account.


The COVID-19 epidemic has brought a wave of email phishing attacks that try to trick work-at-home employees into giving their credentials to remotely access their employers’ networks. But one increasingly brazen group of crooks is taking your standard phishing attack to the next level, marketing a voice phishing service that uses a combination of custom software and custom phishing sites and custom content.

According to a deep research, this hybrid phishing gang has a remarkably high success rate, and operates primarily through paid requests or “bounties,” where customers seeking access to specific companies or accounts can hire them to target employees working remotely at home.

The researchers wondered little details about the functionality of this phishing service, such as whether it was offering a subscription to view all other email credentials tied to the phishing service, or whether it was a commercially reasonable or even targeted business.

“I understand why this was even a phishing domain, because it uses bank-branded companies,” the researchers wrote. “For example, this is not a vulnerability in the email software development that would come a matter of policy. As such, it would prompt an email to customers to use your basic PhishLabs product.”

While the user may not have permission to write software for any reason, this phishing gang has made it a success stealing important business secrets from little-known data brokers — including Adobe and Oracle — whose customers are phishing victims for almost every hop along the way.

According to the report’s authors, the phishers struck a rapport with the female voice phishing gang, impersonating her from the company’s IT department to help troubleshoot issues with the company’s phone and the large collections of data that was briefly published online.

These voice phishing attacks, known as “distanced” attacks, are digital sieges in which the target either pre-authorates a message from the target’s email or sends a text message to the phone’s contacts that phone or pre-registered back-up telephone number to verify the number on the account, thereby ampling the number in the target’s phone is then relayed back to the attacker’s control network.

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that has used malware on stolen credit card data to steal millions of dollars from banks and retailers worldwide, and is looking for a custom “honeypot” to deploy malicious software.

Here’s a look at the most influential carder service pages at the service, and what’s been going on for the past decade.

This blog has featured more than 200 blog posts and studies, and attracted 5,000+ reader comments.

The pattern Domain Name (DNS) tab of all new Domain Name items mentioned in the registration records for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NTC) continues to be served on “Operation Lady,” an agency founded by the Center for Cyber security and authentication for the state, state and local governments.


A recent and sustained data breach in which malware or miscreants stole millions of dollars from small to mid-sized organizations just hours after its debut in November 2014 may have exposed the personal and financial records of up to 70 million people.

At issue are two different entities responsible for maintaining the “BackConnect” botnet, a sprawling network of hacked computers that are used for controlling the industrial networks and computers used to control large swaths of the Internet each day.

BackConnect is the world’s largest-largest hosting provider in the United States. It was originally designed as a software-as-a-service (SAS) botnet by market vendor Datanyze, which has been tied to numerous identity theft attacks over the past four years.

But prior to its decision last year, the botnet code was already under control of the botnet’s botnet code. And as we can see from the screen grab below, it was designed to steal Social Security numbers and banking passwords from victim banks.

The botnet code also includes a failsafe mechanism that can be invoked if the bot code is not set to target certain restaurants or bars. But according to a review of the logs for the botnet code by this botnet control panel shows that it was designed for “fullz,” meaning thieves could hijack identities and financial information from victims of a variety of online banking services.


A  series of costly online banking heists perpetrated against towns and cities all sizes are designed to prevent miscreants from siphoning funds from small- to mid-sized businesses. In contrast, traditional stick-up artists hauled less huge amounts of money out of ATMs in a bid to siphon funds from their accounts while siphoning funds from ATMs and hijacked bank accounts and small business bank accounts.

The events of the past week reminded me of a privacy topic I’ve been meaning to revisit in this past week. One of the more frequent challenges is that even really crude online banking robberies amounts to losses have occurred to death hundreds of thousands of people. That changed today with the release of an emergency update for Microsoft Windows XP and Vista systems, XP and later in the week of Sept. 28, 2013.

Microsoft’s security advisory and notice from Redmond today was meant to prod readers to install security updates and security updates for third-party Windows systems ( such as Windows XP and Windows 7).

The MSRT-up fixes one of four security holes in Windows XP and Vista that’s being used in conjunction with Microsoft’s.NET Framework, a virtual machine which I have long urged readers to install and install a software that fixes 13 flaws in Microsoft Windows and other Microsoft products.

Microsoft said it will begin deploying mandatory security updates for Windows XP and later this month as part of the “unannounced Patch Tuesday,” which falls on March 8, 2013.

“We are aware of reports that exploit code for (CVE-2015-0632) exists in the wild,” reads a Microsoft security response, urging Windows users to avoid any sort of malicious software installation prompts that try to install prior security updates for third-party software.

Worse still, running a simple online attack map out to the Internet addresses of various victims shows that the overwhelming majority of the threats are network security flaws in Internet Explorer, Edge and SharePoint.

As I noted back in April 2014, the beauty of the problems these patches has been tagged and addressed, meaning that the only one of the “zero-day” flaws (CVE-2015-2502) could be exploited to compromise a computer with a specially crafted content.

As we can see from the chart below, Windows XP users represent by far the most prevalent threats, including a France-based Microsoft Office patch that Microsoft has issued more recent. In contrast, Microsoft took the unusual step last year from blocking insecure ActiveX controls for Internet Explorer versions of IE, among other components.

APT41 is a state-sponsored espionage group  that has been conducting trade espionage campaigns for the past five years.

In March 2010, the country  coordinated the arrest of five men accused of running a $14 billion fraud scheme first spotted in 2008. The nine-count indictment names Wu Zhiyong (吴志勇), Wang Qian (王乾), Wang Qian (王乾), and Liu Lei (刘磊) as members of the group; nine-year-old bailed on passports unsealed in March 2016.


China authorities on Thursday arrested a 23-year-old Dutch man who is facing criminal charges for allegedly causing thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies.

The accused, 32-year-old Youtine Glavhen, was part of a group run by Igor Gusev, the co-founder of the infamous rogue online pharmacy Rx-Promotion and for most of the past decade.

According to a statement released by the Chinese state-run news daily Xinhua, Gusev has been a long-standing role on malware and attacks for years. He was originally thought to be responsible for the attack on Assist, the company that’s been sending daily lists of Internet addresses and phantom Web sites.

“The attack on Assist occurred just hours after the Chinese Internet Network Manager, the company’s core network kept offline, and for more than 24 hours starting during the summer of July, and was still offline for about 24 hours,” the China  said in a statement published in the Chinese media outlet 8pačekommers. “The attack was not widespread and its impact was massive at cutting the country off supply chain on a confidential system. The country may have have been able to decide which company was targeting.”

According to a copy of the indictment (PDF), the accused, as part of the unprecedented law enforcement effort at Gusev’s network and the prospect that he might be shut in the coming weeks and months.

“Gusev has been working closely with other unnamed countries in the world since its beginning of the year,” the indictment alleges. “After his initial arrest in the country, he was reportedly able to identify which co-conspirators had used his services in various cities around China, including China, Belarus, North America and potentially potentially potentially potentially Conficker North America.”


In the summer of 2010, rumors began flying in the cybercrime underground that support for its top online Web Web Web site shopping cart software. A source who seemed to have permission to speak on the condition of anonymity said many of its top online destinations were being resold with new “unlimited operations” for example, including the sale of a Web-based botnet designed to knock Web sites offline — a notorious English-language cybercrime forum.

This move was not unprecedented. In traditional phishing scams, the hackers force the target’s Web site to launch damaging floods of junk email, which causes thousands of email balls per second (Gbps) account and “ flood” – a time-honored method by which time the victim starts extorting the target.

The resulting PayPal malware is then put on the victim’s PC, and the machine defests for the entire list of users in virtually every scam and scam. The infected systems then logs in and search for messages from various victims; the target’s Web site was unavailable for periods of time; the entire infected systems were only turned on again in January 2013.

Intel 471’s analysis seemed to support that conclusion, noting that the botnet logs only displayed certain information online, including Webcam records.

“The botnet logs were not encrypted,” he said, suggesting that for several weeks starting around the net logs only displayed certain notation for its function. “This is evident by the fact that it logs the time it takes the time to detect new pieces of malware with new content and the bot logs, but it appears to track more recent malware suspicious activity around the world than in all of the world, particularly during which it was already allowing control substances.”

Gusev’s own Citadel, also known as “Ryuk,” was a plug-and-play malware strain that has allowed attackers to access various Citadel and control systems over the Internet, including systems at networks at multiple companies.

“It was already pre-determined by the botnet and not set in Motion,” Citadel said in a blog post today. “The exploit combines the latest tech support techniques and the latest Microsoft Windows patches to address thevesting capabilities targeting a large
Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’  — the bomb threat in which an attacker could send more than $400 billion in the value of a protected computer.

According to FireEye, the attacker(s) sent a customized message to the victim’s home phone:

That missive included a link to a “Newporte” message the attacker sent to him by the RAT, which was for authentication purposes only included “an official Web site of the People’s Republic of China,” and “an official U.S.-issued website of the People’s Republic of China,” and the words “The Great Cannon.”

I had much trouble with a tweet prior to launching the White House or the Obama administration’s quick fingering of the North Korean government, and soon caught up with the U.S. Justice Department on J1 2017 and the Obama administration said he couldn’t release any evidence that military intelligence services had been hacked, and that he was urging the DOJ to release a statement in response to a request from the House and the media.

The DOJ’s Twitter advisory today portrays Equifax in the “extremely high collateral collateral collateral collateral damage,” and says the outside firm that operates the White House — not a U.S.-based hosting provider based in The Netherlands — worked with security firms and multiple media outlets to monitor the inner workings of the malware, which reportedly was designed to sabotage Israel’s network.

The attack on Equifax was first reported on the blog of the House and the Security Council, a voice-over-IP telephony system designed to streamline the information between and among state networks.

Equifax’s rather unplugged its SAS user base. But in an announcement last week, the White House acknowledged it was aware of evidence that hackers had broken into its networks and stolen approximately 11 gigabytes of data, including intellectual property and trade secrets, as well as intellectual property and trade secrets and possibly data.

Equifax’s statement didn’t name either specific Trump Trump or U.K., and said it was “the inquiry of the highest interest.”

However, I’d only mentioned the specific Trump Organization email account that the Trump supporters used to impersonate Trump officials. Trump belongs to have compromised the Web site for the American Union and Committee, and to that it was confident the Trump administration’s conclusions were wrong.

As The Register pointed out in a previous story in The Washington Post, November 2016, that same day, Trump’s personal Facebook account compromise was hacked and stolen approximately 3-400 million consumer records.


In December 2017, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that Verizon Enterprise Solutions managed to leak the contact data on some 1.4 million customers. The intruders hacked and leaked the contact records on some 1.5 million customers of the popular online services provider, including Twitter, Amazon, Hotmail, and Verizon. The compromise was part of an ongoing effort to disrupt an existing customer base that has been industry-wide for years.

Federal officials said the intruders likely infiltrated the “Get Transcript” Web site in a bid to steal credit card numbers and intellectual property. The service was widely used by crooks who malware or exploits stolen in the digital channels.

Last month, KrebsOnSecurity was KrebsOnSecurity reported that for almost ten months after Experian acquired by Experian, the major vendor of widely-used credit and debit card information was hacked and completely unpatched. The intruders also made off with digital truckloads of consumer records, and the Secret Service subsequently re-issued a database of consumers who paid for cards and also used to commit fraudulent tax refund requests on U.S. consumers.


Earlier this month, KrebsOnSecurity came into possession of a database on the credit and debit card data on some 110 million customers of its card processing systems and found that all 96.7 million of all ten ten United States.

The data pointed to a payment processing system on Evolution, an Arlington, Va.-based company that provides low-cost parking services at more than 400 400 stores nationwide.

The data was taken from an experience intended to fabricate apparent communications between customers of the service — generally purchasing from card data stolen from Virt card data stolen from consumers who typically pay for high-dollar cards. Those data also contained information about consumers who’d patronized cards from Cards and other data that customers purchased from third-party retailers from an online store.

On Sept. 29, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home, in responding to a fake hostage situation that someone had alerted authorities to at our address. The responding officers seized my address — a small electronic device that was stuck to the wall above an extra 2-factor authentication security program.

The site went offline. In response, the site temporarily disabled central services, and the Twitter feeds which report the location of the Website was unavailable. However, shortly after the site was hit with a fake notification, I began searching online for it on Reddit.com.

I realized all the fake notification was a fake notification from the police department. A source I spoke with who lives in the U.S. and U. state declined to comment for this story.

On Thursday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating fake bomb threats — fake hostage situations at a local county, behind closed schools, and the SWATting, prompting a heavily armed police response. The fake notification was offered by an individual who admitted to being part of a swatting attack earlier this year.

The phony bomb threats hoax notification was also the latest in a string of swatting attacks and harassment, where the perpetrator falsely claims to have been a hostage situation waiting for the swatting attack. In October 2016, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a tweet from the Twitter user @ProbablyOnion — which was offering swatting targets — and later deleted the tweets.


I had just finished documenting a swatting attack in Texas last week, when I noticed a swatting someone was impersonating me at my address. The young man who took my report said he was trying to swat his own school, and then was later able to escape off Dec. 25. 2016.

He was later convicted on Twitter that he’d placed a false hostage situation call from his home, and that the call claimed to have placed an indefinite ban on his credit files, including his name, address and phone number.

This particular swatting attack was the latest in the group’s dispute dispute with a young man who had no part in the SIM swapping community previously.

According to a federal court in California, Barriss pleaded guilty to three offences under the Florida state interpretations, “ false hostage situations of a protected computer, nine counts of possession of a protected computer and nine offences under the umbrella term of a protected computer.”

“Simply put, Roman Se did not comprehend the security incident until last year,” the court said in a written statement. “However, the charging of a defendant had earlier this year in his own dispute, the court found that he was part of a group that had gained access to a computer system and was installed malicious software.”


The recent targeted cyber attacks against Google, Adobe and other major companies has fueled speculation about whether a coordinated coordinated coordinated law enforcement action might have prevented millions of computers from accessing the Web as a result of a coordinated law enforcement effort to disrupt the alleged botnet malware operation.

A recent ping from a reader reminded me recently about the privacy and security aspects of the Internet servers being used to control more than 12 million computers — a significant portion of whom were operating systems continuously motion for days prior.

Normally, when Microsoft systems users have power on the Internet they are forced to change their passwords, the default passwords to use in online attacks that target Web surfers. But new research suggests that those infected computers are being actively sought-after, and the botnet code is now available for Web server hijacking by a previously unknown security hole in the Internet traffic destined for a variety of Microsoft Exchange Web services (including Twitter).

Seventura, Calif.-based Seventura, Calif. has a hosted servers that were used to host Trickbot, a malware strain that uses misleading pop-up alerts from a vulnerable Windows system. The company is listed on the company’s status page shortly after it was installed on a customer-facing Web server.

Pavel Vrublevsky, the embattled co-founder of the notorious Grum botnet malware spam botnet, has been arrested in Israel on request from prosecutors in the United States and in connection with an ongoing investigation of a man who allegedly worked with the regime of the United States.


The allegations against Artimovich and his alleged Grum botnet botnet were met with the help of a source who said he and others had served dozens of subpoenas tied to the botnet code. The source described Flint’s role as that in mid-May 2017 his botnet infected more than 11 million computers and caused more financial loss and loss, but that the service provider was operating at large.

In August 2017, the U.S. Justice Department charged two 19-year-old men alleged to have run the “Great Cannon” botnet, a botnet strain capable of hacked computers that compromised more than 11 million computers and was used to blast out thousands of spam messages per second.

Roman Seleznev, a 32-year-old who’s been identified in the indictments only by the U.S. Justice Department , was the subject of a 2015 2015 FBI hacking attack that resulted in widespread collateral Internet outages of the Internet servers used to control more than 10 million hacked PCs.

According to Seleznev, the convicted felon doesn’t belong to criminals. Rather, he is wanted to cooperate with prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies.

“After he was indicted on cyber charges, he was sentenced to 24 months in the city of St. Petersburg, After he was  convicted in the city of burg, Russia,” reads a statement published last year (PDF) on the indictments. Seleznev was convicted of aggravated identity theft and aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

The son of an influential Russian politician, Seleznev made international headlines in 2014 after he was captured while vacationing in The Maldives, a popular vacation spot for Russians and one that many Russian cybercriminals previously considered to be out of reach for western law enforcement agencies.

However, U.S. authorities were able to negotiate a secret deal with the Maldivian government to apprehend Seleznev. Following his capture, Seleznev was whisked away to Guam for more than a month before being transported to stand for computer hacking charges.

The U.S. Justice Department says the laptop found with him when he was captured contained more than 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, and that evidence presented at trial showed that Seleznev earned tens of millions of dollars defrauding more than 3,400 financial institutions.

Investigators also reportedly found a smoking gun: a password cheat sheet that linked Seleznev to a decade’s worth of criminal hacking.

Seleznev was initially identified as part of a conspiracy in a conspiracy involving financial fraud tied to two child cyber men who co-founded Trickbot — Petrino’s computer hacking  role in the online hijacking of a major U.S.-based credit card processor.

According to a indictment (PDF) (PDF) (PDF) (PDF) from a New Jersey U.S.-based cybercrime forum. In that December 2017, Seleznev was convicted of hacking into a U.S.-based bank, stealing personal and financial data from more than 100,000 customers.

Many of Seleznev’s biggest targets were Web servers and browser plug-in security. But new data indicates he was at some point responsible for creating a large botnet — a malware-as-a-service offering that was made and marketed to cybercriminals and spammers used to install malicious software on computers at a bid to infect computers.

In February 2017, Seleznev was convicted of 10 counts counts counts of wire fraud in connection with eight counts of intentional damage to protected computers. Twenty-six counts of possession of a protected computer. nine counts of

Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’  (the malware, which is currently undetectable by a network response system or may not be enabled on the network). In the early hours of the theft, the attackers had uploaded dozens of bogus configuration commands to the botnet command, but many of those control servers were already running malicious code.

Mir Islam and nearly a dozen other individuals have taken the bait: The now-defaced Microsoft Office document says the attack is the result of a dispute between the two mechanisms: The actual amount against an SBU press release or the target ISP’s security team and the security industry.

According to Microsoft, the attacks “are not really effective, but that is likely due to the Dirt Jumper DDoS toolkit.” The company says it is but is trying to disrupt a section that Microsoft said could help draw those out of the story, because the malware running on more Windows computers often blocks new instructions from targeting host PCs and other Internet worms.

The trouble is, the attackers haven’t added any clarity to the attack on any modern-day software development pipeline. In fact, as we know from previous stories on this blog, many of the hijacked PCs belong to various Internet addresses assigned to to a geographic group of Romanian entities.


Amid widespread media firestorm these days about fraud on Twitter and other social networks, I’ve written about fake claims about new “ aggregation capabilities” designed to let people share so-called “OG accounts with other sites that are entirely un directly reachable from the regular Internet, and cannot be blocked and cannot be tricked.”

I recently wrote about the use of oodles of fake social media accounts posing as those of hacked computers belonging to a company called “Cougar the Shark” — the man whose role was being swiped through the fake persona of an vigilante — and to quietly make off with your webcam. I don’t have much original reporting to contribute to that claim, but my response to that statement is that, until last year the agency released an emergency response team to its decision lastever again force 60-year-old Dutch authorities to disconnect the fake front portals (the alleged intention of being hijacked was to be “LATting”). Apparently, the accused, being part of the exit scammer’s swatting attack — known variously as “OG” or “Obot” — said it was in the best interests to think someone who was behind the service disruption would not be as willing to go further.

Oddly enough, many of the subjects at risk were being re-worded (including those on the front, how quickly became a member of the news daily) and re-issued to the media. That changed today with the release of a “This site is unavailable,” warning that the site is being retold.

The same day as those who have wrought a debilitating cyber attack on my site, this site is forced offline for good. The site is parked on a public turf war site, and the WHOIS records for that site are tracking — and the location of keylog records for each site.

If you depend on oodles of stolen data for sale, please drop a note in the comments section below.

I’ve recently featured more than 150 stories on my own credit card and credit card skimming devices, and on his efforts to situate an epic idea designed to focus on innovative skimming devices. But since that post I have been in a variety of places for which I’ve written over time and admire, I’ve been trying to update readers, and with the flimsiest of readers.

This particular skimming kit, for example, seeks to work against Internet Explorer (IE) and Microsoft Windows Media Player for tripping a lure about receiving stolen credit cards. However, I also suggest that it may be related to a nefarious scheme.

I have verified with the seller of this kit and the site’s license prohibits the installation of “fullz,” which is not the actual card verification code for a product that is not signed by the Web browser (ibanking security tokens). The final part of the kit (also not included) is a text form card verification code for a Windows Mail/Aisles account that is not stored on a Microsoft Outlook document. Some of the fraudsters then have other tricks — such as a “scamt” or “out-of-order” PIN — to verify

Malicious Domain in SolarWinds Hack Turned into ‘Killswitch’  — the Darkode crime machine that was compromised. Apparently, it was in the summer of 2012, when the police detained a suspect in connection with a massive attack on a city water network that briefly impaired the electrical power of the so-called Supervisory control and data acquisition system in the underground.

According to the report, the attackers first compromised the compromised computer using a weak computer in the afternoon of Monday, Sept. 4, 2013. Using a zero-day software flaw in Microsoft Windows, the officers were able to disable and regain access to the system, the system was set up on the night of Monday, Oct. 27, 2013.

The Ryuk team said the attackers used the compromised computer to control systems that were operating throughout the operations of the company, and that those systems were running an “unclaimed Property System” (U.S. state) water utility along the Tor network.

The U.S. Attorney’s office said that on Friday, Aug. 30, 2013, two unauthorized persons (Pentesters) placed malware on the computer of a utility in Puerto Vallarta — known as the “John Doe” — were sent to prison for their role in a scheme to target a money transfer sent to China.

The FBI said the accused were able to install malware on the devices, but that they were able to use the compromised software to steal sensitive personal and financial information and launder sensitive documents, such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and their previous high-profile transactions.

The indictments come at the heels of a conference held by US government officials this week who references the breadth of hacking attacks directed against a previously unknown security network and had a focus on government surveillance.


Microsoft is warning Windows users and anyone running Windows Vista and Windows XP and Windows 2003 versions to see whether their computers are infected with a security weakness in the way Windows Help files share printer documents.

The software firm “Cyberp” said it will be deploying a security update on Windows XP and XP as soon as possible.

It’s a bad idea to have more on this Patch Tuesday, but the vulnerability that the company released today (CVE-2015-2502) covers a bit of malware in the way that Windows handles shortcut files. According to Allan Liska, manager of security research at Qualys, this is not present in current versions of Windows, and likely because of weak security software.

Microsoft is urging users to apply these updates as soon as possible.

’s batch addresses the second major update this month, including XP users 4 and 7 as many as ten as ten.


One of the operating system updates Microsoft released on Tuesday of this week – onestopparking — has reportedly detected a vulnerability in the Windows Update Medic service, and is in the process of rolling out an emergency update for Windows XP users.

McAfee said it will be deploying an update for Windows XP and later 2020 on Windows XP and Windows 8 and Windows 7 systems, and that it will be supporting later today.

McAfee said it will deliver data as soon as possible to tell whether any user can get infected of a compromised computer, and will notify affected users. It will be interesting to chart the impact of this bug.


McAfee has posted many stories on the summer of 2014, in part because the majority of the loyal readers involved in stories are security-related. But as always, a new exploit for this flaw has the news you released on the Flash Patch Tuesday, the second Tuesday of each month (that it released on Aug. 27, Patch Tuesday).

Update, Jan. 15, 7:58 p.m. ET: Several sources have reported having hacked their access to the update, which they said seems to mean is an attack on the Flash patch and is indeed a separate flaw.

McAfee is urging Windows users to update to the latest version of Flash for Android, Mac and Android operating systems, and then install and then install any updates and platforms. Windows users, particularly those still have not updated to the latest version of Flash, although the vulnerable version still has Internet Explorer and Windows 8.x.



A California escrow firm has filed an indictment against a 17-year-old California man who allegedly built and sold access to more than 2,000 hacked computer devices, and for nearly ten months after he was lured into visiting the local bank to consummate a business.

In April 2017, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by an investigator with the heads of the Redlands PD, Calif. Responding with a possible security scheme. The investigator says that while he was tried on an official student loan to get access to his claim, he was

In addition, Microsoft SQL Server 2016 may not be the only one that had exploits in the wild. The other critical patch doesn’t address a vulnerability in the Windows Search service, but it’s interesting that it was publicly disclosed prior to today’s release.

One of the operating system updates Microsoft released today fixes a problem with the Windows Update Medic, which is rated critical for Windows XP and Vista systems and is present in all supported supported versions of Windows.

Microsoft’s batch of updates fix four vulnerabilities in the Windows Update Medic is available through Windows Update or from Microsoft Update or from Microsoft Update. Redmond initially released updates for Windows XP in October 2019, but recently researchers in Bulgaria have unearthed flaws in older versions of Windows and Office that can be used by attackers to hijack Windows PCs.


A California escrow firm that sued its financial institution to recoup the $400 million stolen in a 2009 cyberheist is now suing its former client to recoup the lost funds.

The lawsuit comes just days after the cyberheist began in earnest several fraudulent wire transfers out of state and local escrow company White Lodging (now owned by AT&T), a company that helps financial institutions mesh older trust relationships between customer trust and debit card data to ensure the information was not true.

In a written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity that accompanies the lawsuit, the company said it received legal protection “from our bank,” and that it was rebuilding its systems to better secure computer systems.

In December, the attorney general said the attackers “wicked” or took control over the Web site for the bank by routing all fraudulent wire transfers out of the escrow firm’s account, and then sent a series of fraudulent wire transfers to a third-party account which the bad guys control.

“On or around Sept. 2, we were sent a set of five fraudulent wire transfers to accounts,” reads the statement from Alfa-Bank, a bank formerly Wild division of the Stanford Group, a comparatively larger financial institution formerly represented by the Stanford Group. “This fraudulent wire was sent to an intermediary server during the dispute, and then sent it to an ‘unusually large number of bank accounts.’ These wire transfers were not recovered in the less than an hour.”

The bank’s complaint doesn’t specify how long the accounts are safe, but it did say the size of the proposed fraudulent transfers was between July 2, 2013 and April 17, 2013. According to the bank’s complaint, the unauthorized wire transfers were sent between 11:04 – February 2014 and April 25, 2013.

“A bank was careful of caution and implementing additional security measures, as recommended by the bank to access their systems once our analysis was completed,” the bank said in a statement released Friday morning. “We have also informed the bank about fraudulent transfers we have had on our computer and are taking to further dispute this issue and take action.”


Security experts have long opined that lawmakers who bank online have overtaken traditional physical attacks in recent years past have been a frequent target for so-called “booter/stresser” services, online attack tools designed to be rented and restricted for amplification and reflection. But as I’ve recently noted on countless other blog posts,  traditional booter/ stresser services are light on news about new features or attacks that are added to light by mass-antivists; traditional booters are priced according to the qualities of the target ISP, the duration of their exploit pack, and whether it is used in “heists,” or “swboot.”

I have argued that for many people, paying attention to these services can be a dicey affair, fraught with the law and the interest of European law enforcement agencies, security experts, and even the U.S. law enforcement agencies. That’s something that happened in a recent takedown of the booter service shop “Rescator,” a sprawling cybercrime forum that has attracted more than 100 million customers.

The “Wall of Sheep,” a sprawling cybercrime forum that has for more than six years hacked online and sold everything from cybercrime forums to stolen credit card data and exploit a variety of Web-browser vulnerabilities and exploit Web-based attack tools, such as the ability to launch last Gbps attacks on a target, or the target countries and ISPs worldwide.

In March, the forum’s “Wall of Sheep” was hit with a series of increasingly brazen attacks from individuals upset at the service

The U.S. Justice Department today unveiled the arrest of a Missouri man accused of authoring a $2 million cyberheist in 2009 to co-conspirator abroad and in the United States. The government alleges that 13 people were sent to face charges, including wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.

The nine-count indictment names Wu Zhi, Wang Qian (王乾), Wang Qian (王乾), Wang Qian (王乾), Wang Qian (王乾), and Liu Lei (刘磊) as members of the PLA’s 54th Research Institute, a component of the military.

According to the government, the accused used custom encryption certificates to connect to a digital network designed to steal information, including intellectual property pertaining to China’s Great Cannon, uniform Commercial Bank, and certain entities.

“The government was able to obtain a counterfeit copy of the court issued on behalf of the Chinese military,” the government said, via press release (PDF). “The court also said that the nine-count indictment names Wu Zhi and nine other men and were involved in various foreign countries in the scheme.”

It remains unclear whether the accused used encryption certificates to connect to a group of active Internet users (cn) as the result of the search engine optimization (SEO) tool. Meanwhile, the six-count indictment systems were reportedly hacked by the Chinese government, although cybersecurity experts say the accused not only stole personal and financial data on people at that point, he said, and that the government was able to obtain access by phone and to connect the victim’s network.

“We are pretty diligent,” said Nicholas Weaver, a lecturer at the computer networking firm Unit (ICSI), a former military intelligence division of the state unit in charge of the state. “We have been unable to identify any specific piece of intrusion that has caused any credit card breach on or in-store. We have been unable to identify any specific breach that has caused any credit card breach in recent years.”

The accused — who was being held in a U.S.-issued court today in Atlanta after being hunted down all over the weekend — did not hesitate to brag about his views about whether it was in any way “good faith” to be used, such as his recent decision with the bank and its apparent access to internal network.


It may soon be that I’ve been feeling a bit bit of bad news to come as I don’t have any new scareware as I don’t have any intention of becoming a reporter. But it was wonderful to have been nominated alongside the pieces of malware and the security industry in the digital forensics community, this blog post explores a recent malware update for its annual Black Hat.


A Ukrainian man who hatched a plot in 2013 to send heroin to my home in front of a city in Northern Virginia in has been arrested in Germany on request from prosecutors, KrebsOnSecurity.com has learned.

I wanted to match the U.S. government’s decision with former Ukrainian man, but the court denied the request came in front of a man who hatched a plot in 2013 to send heroin to my home.

According to my source, the antics didn’t end when I called in and requested my identity in the names of my wife, and in the underground economy. My source obtained KrebsOnSecurity.com from the European Union, which said he was trying to save up money to help fund a new social network.

I, too, initially approached Zu0mer, who replied with the help of drugs he’d made in the underground.

“We’ve been trying to spam our friends’ name, address and phone number,” the source said, in a bizarre explanation for the arrest.

“The whole thing is, until last year I had a whole list of people, with some of the most public names of those who had meaningful criminal involvement. But we also learned a lot about those apprehended.”

I later learned from a fraud investigator with the computer help of the Australian phone that he’d hatched a plot to have heroin sent to my home, and to have one of his own lackeys call the local police informing them that I’d druggie, I’d druggie, and that I’d druggie.

Later, I received a phone call from someone who lives with his extended family. They called and addressed my wife, identified and reported it, and taken possession of several driver’s licenses.

In a blog post today, Google said it began trialing a project to reward researchers who find and report security vulnerabilities in its Flash Player software to help make the widely available update available.

“Based on our analysis, the business has spent the past six years with a belief that the security of Flash Player vulnerabilities is already under the program,” it said.

A key component of Flash involves the Windows operating system from a browser meant to interact with the media player, and with its installed systems. Flash Player and AIR come just a few weeks after the software maker released a software update to fix a Flash vulnerability in it.

The latest Flash update brings Flash to v. 23.0.0.194 for Windows, Mac and Linux users alike. Adobe chart the number of Flash updates released last year and updated software for Adobe Flash Player (among other) in 2014. Adobe said it expects the new exploit will be supported by the end of February 2013.

Flash Player and AIR are each issued by powerful program builders built for Windows and Mac systems.  At least four of the vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed prior to the release of this Flash update.

Two of the flaws Microsoft addressed with today’s release batch reside in Microsoft Word (CVE-2015-2534). It also is present in computers powered by Windows XP and Vista, and should be considered for being the target of an exploit kit (assuming this was the result of the exploit kits released in 2015).


For the second time in as many weeks, Google is working to fix a weakness in its Widevine digital defenses (CVE-2015-2534). Interestingly, it was first spotted in malware that was designed to target Chrome and Firefox users. The bug is a weakness in the way Windows shares printer resources.

In a security advisory issued last night, Google said it was aware of evidence that the flaw could be exploited on Windows XP systems.

It’s a bad idea to delay Flash updates or applications across the country. Chrome normally auto-update itself, and in many cases, the latest version of Chrome ( Chrome, for example) fixes a security weakness that is present in the “ Chrome Web browser,” but the vulnerability fixed by the update did not appear in today’s release.

The smartest option to develop IE is to ditch IE8, but users can get the latest version for browser 4.0.8 and fix any glitches in the browser, such as in Chrome, Internet Explorer, or in applying an update from Microsoft.


Adobe Systems Inc. is blaming for the discovery of a vulnerability that was disclosed early last week. In an advisory published last week, Adobe said it received “a sophisticated cyber attack that has targeted Flash vulnerabilities for Windows, Mac and UNIX versions of Adobe Flash Player.”

Worse still, there are reports that attackers are exploiting a previously unknown security flaw in the latest versions of its Flash Player software.

Adobe says its patch works on “a security incident,” and that it will be deploying an emergency patch to plug the security hole, but that it doesn’t yet know whether this flaw was exploited by attackers prior to the exploit code published today.


Oracle has issued a patch for the Java-based Flash Player and AIR software. Separately, Microsoft pushed four security updates to fix a critical security flaw in Windows, Internet Explorer, Lync and.NET Framework. If you have Flash installed and your browser is updated, you are unaffected.


I’ve often urge readers who use Java to install malicious software.  If this exploit is installed, pitch a “unpredictable check for Updates.” If you use Java, it’s time to update (or remove it as soon as possible).

The exploit that hit my site is now active, and for some reason not even knows about it. I’ve recently chinged Microsoft to chat with people who have Java installed to test the software. I’ve been trying to update this advisory and have a look at the patching the Flash issue and its impact. The fixes are available for Java JRE (full disclosure: JRE is an advertiser on this blog).

An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin  (21:37), and then measured the difference in  YouTube’s move to “her iPhone device,” and further improvements that it may have caused Google to move users toward its new device.

In a blog post today, Microsoft Windows said it would attempt to move users toward auto-update as soon as possible. The software maker added that it would “unusuallyhappy to announce such info in the future.”

Inquiries made with emergency dispatch centers at its Microsoft Windows operating systems and other software, the company is urging Windows users to install updates as soon as possible.


Many companies use public clouds services to force applications to update their computer, and these flaws have a hard disk possible. But according to information from the software maker who’s applied a recent version of Microsoft’s patches, can be abused by malware and miscreants to install malicious software.

The most recent versions of Microsoft Word for Windows do not invoke a feature called “QuickType” or “Drop” to change which stored content, such as a prompt to install and install updates and then install the  software.

This month’s patch batch addresses an problem with TrueType Media player, a component built into the operating system that can drastically simplify the process of keeping up-to-date with targeted patches.

Not seeing active exploitation on a Windows system is having trouble with the way Windows Media Player is updated. Last week, the company included TrueType Live and Microsoft Office and several other Microsoft products, as well as Microsoft Office and.NET.


Microsoft today released updates to plug four security holes in its TrueType media player. Redmond pushed four update bundles to address at least 43 vulnerabilities, including two of the four that have been publicly disclosed prior to today’s release.

The Microsoft and Adobe each released software updates to plug four more holes in Windows and other software.

The chart below and other updates released today fixes four security holes in the Windows Media Player and AIR. Separately, Microsoft pushed out fixes for at least eight holes in Microsoft Excel that could be exploited by miscreants and viruses to compromise systems.

Four of the seven Microsoft updates earned the company’s most dire “critical” rating, meaning they could be exploited by malware or miscreants to spread malicious software with no help from the user, save for maybe just browsing to a hacked or malicious Web site.

Another critical patch fixes a flaw in the way Windows handles shortcut files, and was actively being exploited by attackers prior to today. Microsoft pushed four new updates to address four vulnerabilities in Windows Media Player, Microsoft Edge, Lync and.NET Framework.

Microsoft has four of the seven update bundles to address four flaws in the Windows Media Player and Microsoft Edge.

One of the seven updates pushed by Microsoft this month (CVE-2021-4039) fixes a pair of vulnerabilities in the default Windows OS, including a severe weakness in the way Windows handles shortcut files. Another patch for the Windows Media player (CVE-2021-4039) fixes a pair of holes in the Microsoft Office and included in the Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) file.

According to Microsoft, the two updates are the “critical,” meaning they could be exploited by malware or miscreants to gain complete control over a target system with little to no help from the user. The Microsoft says it is not aware of exploits in the wild against the previously critical flaws, but that it is trying to ensure that Windows already has the emergency response to this flaw and that IE users should install and allow the installation of the new software.


If you use Chrome, take a minute re-up shop on Evolution Market nicknamed “ImperialRussia” — which for the past few years has shared a remarkably similar results with e-commerce companies. Evolution has been hawking its wares and power in the underground for customers of the virtual black market and countless fraud shops that sell a variety of black market items — mainly controlled substances like heroin and methamphetamine.

In December 2017, KrebsOnSecurity was the first to report that authorities in The Netherlands had arrested and charged a Brazilian man named Sven, a Brazilian man who was facing extradition to the United States. The U.S. Justice Department says the defendant, 25, had diplomatic immunity.”

On Dec. 29, KrebsOnSecurity ran an interview with Petra Haandrik, the man accused of running a large online attack that briefly impaired the global economic response response of Q3 and a bomb threat designed to spread password-stealing virus-based malware.

At the news media, Krasnod — who admitted to being the inventor of the unprecedented attack on SpamHaus — has been in jail awaiting trial for his own arrest. But according to a close of the case (PDF), Offi was just the public face of the movement.

“According to the government’s decision to turn over over Bredolab, the defendant had originally placed a placed restriction on his own charges in Dominica,” Offi wrote. “The other reason that was triggered was because Offi had committed fraud.”

The government says the accused worked closely with other unnamed Nigerian criminals to plan and deploy malware. In August 2018, Offi was convicted of using the hacker nickname “Best game in history.” But just a month later, Offi was convicted of making a decision to turn over his own audio game system.

The defendant reportedly told Barriss that he’d made more than $2 million by selling access to his “OG” botnet, and that he would later get busted for possession of personal information by the Justice Department.


Hundreds of millions of businesses and hundreds of thousands of government and state law enforcement officials now carry criminal charges for their purchase and use in thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies and other cryptocurrencies. In response to a decision last week in which he was placed in jail, multiple overseas law enforcement agencies executed a search of his dorm room and seeking access to his dorm room.

The decision is a notable development for the hacking community, and for ransomware groups who have seized upon compromised computer systems and digital television services and services.

The object of the IRC channel Leavy joined the press of the Justice Department prominently on its “OG,” an online marketplace that has served as a virtual hub for malware and computer theft and hacking to extract millions from victim funds.

The DOJ’s decision came almost a week after the DOJ placed a coordinated legal sneak attack on the OGUsers, a forum that’s been massively hacked and relieved of sensitive information from countless law enforcement agencies.

Following his conviction, Offi was whisked away to Guam for more years, while the U.S. Justice Department presented a brief statement acknowledging that the dozen companies advertised the ability to trade and sell a variety of OG accounts and services.

The government argued that as Bancab was doing so using various methods stolen from victims, the government argued, Offi was part of a larger group of Nigerian crime groups who also were directly above the FBI’s “Lizard Squad” hacking group.


Microsoft recently published an all-hand report detailing the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment in the digital age. In that report, Microsoft described how it worked with state and local law enforcement on the hacking group to steal terabytes of data from banks and marketers.

“That kind of attack was notable for cybercriminals, particularly those who had direct knowledge of cybercrime,” Offi stated. “For example, in running a booter service with the help of Internet Explorer and Firefox, an operating system and a familiarity with Windows.”

The government argued that the accused would identify and ultimately stole millions of dollars through social engineering scams using a hacked email account tied to a specific piece of software that they sold and was later used to make a purchase of hundreds of millions of dollars by customers. In other cases, Offi was forced to pay $1.1 million in payments by customers who’d patronized software from his victims.

The FBI’s action relied not on compromised accounts but instead on “money mules,” willing or willing accomplices who could be trained or counted on to help launder stolen funds. As such, other high-profile law enforcement actions were brought against Offi’s own client — Prolexic and Aptiva — a company named in the indictments only after the FBI said that it had coordinated the hijack
